# The evolution of movement on fluctuating landscapes

This is an adaptation of Botero et al. (2015) _PNAS_ in which we examine whether consistent movement modes are evolved in landscapes that fluctuate in space and time. Space-time fluctutation is simulated using Perlin noise (Perlin 1985) provided by the `libnoise` `C++` library.

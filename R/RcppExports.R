#' Runs the noisewalker simulation.
#'
#' @description Run the noisewalker simulation using parameters passed as
#' arguments to the corresponding R function.
#' 
#' @param genmax The maximum number of generations per simulation.
#' @param timesteps The number of timesteps per generation.
#' @param nOctaves Number of octaves. May be thought of as small scale 
#' variability. Must be an integer value between 1 and 8. Higher values
#' result in landscapes with more small scale noise.
#' @param frequency Frequency of noise. May be thought of as large scale
#' variability. May be any double value between 1.0 and 16.0. Higher values
#' @param newSrange The sensory range of the population.
#' @param rep The replicate number. Designed to be read from a data.frame.
#' result in noise that is closer to white noise.
#' @return Nothing. Writes an image to file.
